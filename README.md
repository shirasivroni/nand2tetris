# Nand2Tetris Projects

This repository contains my solutions to selected projects from the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course.

The course walks through the complete construction of a modern computer system, from first principles: building hardware from logic gates, creating a virtual machine, developing a compiler, and implementing a simple operating system.

All projects were implemented in **Java**.

## Projects Overview

### Project 6: Assembler
**Goal:**  
Implement a two-pass assembler that translates Hack assembly language (`.asm` files) into Hack binary machine code (`.hack` files).

**Details:**
- Parses A-instructions (`@value`) and C-instructions (`dest=comp;jump`).
- Handles labels and symbols.
- Outputs correct 16-bit binary instructions.

### Project 7: Basic VM Translator
**Goal:**  
Implement a basic VM Translator that translates simple stack-based VM commands into Hack assembly code.

**Supported commands:**
- Arithmetic/Logical commands (`add`, `sub`, `neg`, `eq`, `gt`, `lt`, `and`, `or`, `not`)
- `push` and `pop` operations for the `constant`, `local`, `argument`, `this`, `that`, `temp`, and `pointer` segments.

### Project 8: Full VM Translator
**Goal:**  
Extend the VM Translator to handle:
- Branching commands (`label`, `goto`, `if-goto`)
- Function calling commands (`function`, `call`, `return`)
- Multi-file translation, generating bootstrap code (`Sys.init`)

### Project 10: Jack Syntax Analyzer
**Goal:**  
Implement a syntax analyzer for the Jack programming language.

**Details:**
- Parses `.jack` files according to the Jack grammar.
- Outputs structured XML files representing the syntactic structure of the code.
- Assumes the input Jack programs are error-free.

### Project 11: Jack Compiler
**Goal:**  
Extend the syntax analyzer to a full Jack-to-VM compiler.

**Details:**
- Implements a symbol table to track variable/function declarations.
- Generates executable VM code from Jack source programs.
- Supports class variables, subroutines, memory allocation, function calls, control flow, and more.

## How to Run

Each project contains a `Main.java` entry point.  
You can run each project by compiling and executing `Main.java`, passing as an argument a `.asm`, `.vm`, or `.jack` file or directory, depending on the project.

Example:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main path/to/input
```

Make sure to have Java installed on your machine.

## Tools

For full testing, you can use the CPU Emulator, VM Emulator, and Hardware Simulator tools provided by the [Nand2Tetris website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software).

## Notes
- This repository assumes that input files are syntactically correct, as per the project specifications.
- XML outputs may differ in whitespace, but match structural requirements exactly.
